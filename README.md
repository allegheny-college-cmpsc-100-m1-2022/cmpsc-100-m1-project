# Mini-project

* Assigned: 4 February 2022
* Due: 10 February 2022
  * With interim dates and deliverables along the way

At this point in our work together, we've entered the final phase of our programming journey and have started to make very meaningful things. This project asks your co-op to work together to finish the course with another collection of sorts.

## Our Town

We'll start this project with a small thought exercise: imagine that that you're tasked with introducing a unified line of machines in support of a growing new town. 

What does your co-op build to contribute to this nascent society?

Ideas might include things as small as a bubblegum machine or they could be more utilitarian like a paper shredder. 

With all of the skills we've gained (and extensions of skills, for some of you), this objective is achievable. 

### Your goal

Holistically, your co-op's goal: to introduce and program a collection of objects (many small or a couple larger) that would fulfill the mission of contributing either utility or novelty to our hypothetical digital world.

### The rules

The mini-project is subject to our contract rules with a few highlighted additions given the scope/scale of the work.

#### Contributions

Of course, as with any broad, ambiguous project, a set of guidelines helps:

* Output must involve your _entire_ co-op
  * This means that if you choose to make smaller items, everyone has to create individual contributions
  * If choosing to make medium or larger items, your co-op should clearly divide the labor between the efforts
  * To verify, I will use the `contributors` section of your collaborative repository to rate levels of contribution
* These must appear as `module` (think `class`) files in the `src` folder
* These must operate using the `showroom.py` file in the `src` folder as your `main` controller
* All of your objects _must run_ to receive a `+` on this assignment
  * This is an opportunity for everyone in your co-op to receive an additional `+` mark before the course ends
  * You will recieve a `+` if (and only if) all members of your co-op make siginificant, non-trivial contributions
    * This means editing more than a few lines of code or documentation
    
#### Procedure

* The co-op must fill out a short `proposal.md` to present the idea for review
  * Only `1` of these should exist
  * This document should contain at least `300` words
* All co-op members must fill out a "data sheet" for each object built.
  * To do so, **copy the OBJECT-data-sheet.md** file in the `writing` directory and rename it
    * Rename this file by replacing the word `OBJECT` with your chosen item's name
    * Both of these operations can be achieved via right-clicking the file in the file explorer
  * Any object created _must_ have a corresponding data sheet
* All co-op members must contribute to the `final-report.md` file
  * You only need `1` copy of this file
  * This document should contain at least `500` words
* All changes must go through the `Pull Request` process
  * To review this, revisit either your group's collective web project _or_ course contract worksheets from `week-0`
  * I will also review this with the class
* **All code must appear in the `src` folder**

##### Revisiting `git`

As this is a collective project, follow these procedures for your work:

|Command |Purpose |
|:-------|:-------|
|`git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`| Creates branch; name this for your invention (i.e. `bubblegum_machine`)|
|`git branch`| Verifies you are on the correct branch|
|`git push origin BRANCH_NAME`| `push`es to the associated `branch`|

### Due dates

|Date |Item due |
|:----|:--------|
|4 February, 12:30p | Proposal |
|7 February, 9:30a  | Object data sheets|
|10 Febrary, 11:59p | Final report and all project files |

### Seeking assistance

Co-ops have the ability to request demonstration code from the instructor. However, there is a _deadline_ for this:

* teams may expect demonstration code within 24 hours of a request
* teams may not request demonstration code after `12:00p` on `8 February`

This demonstrations will be provided in a [demonstrations repository](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-m1-2022/cmpsc-100-m1-project-demos), to which you already have access.
